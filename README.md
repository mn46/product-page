# Product page task from Frontend Mentor
A simple product page made with React, including basic functionalities such as adding/removing items to/from cart. To have it a bit more challenging, I decided to try and save the cart content in the local storage.
Design was provided by Frontend Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6.
